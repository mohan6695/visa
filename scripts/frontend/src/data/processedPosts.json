Both the H-1B holder and H-4 holder are currently in the U.S., and the H-1B holder cannot travel for stamping right now due to work constraints. The H-4 holder needs to travel to India for an urgent situation. In this scenario, can the H-4 attend the visa interview independently without H1b, given that both visas were revoked?

Dear U.S. Visa Holder, Please be advised that your U.S. visa has been PRUDENTIALLY REVOKED under section 221i of the Immigration and Nationality Act by the U.S. Department of State on 30-DEC-2025. This action is based on the fact that after visa issuance, information has come to light indicating that you may be inadmissible to the United States and ineligible for your visa. I had a false arrest records which was dismissed even before court appearance and totally removed from records. I had multiple job changes and H1b transfers and stamping in India and Dropbox, never got any issues, just 1st time comsular officer asked documents to prove arrest was dismissed, now suddenly this happened after 8 years I recently got offer from another company and they filed visa transfer for me 10 days ago in premium processing. Did this triggered my visa revocation? I had stamping till 2027 Feb, now that also gone, will this also deny my H1b transfer in USA considering I am here? I am supposed to start working for new company in first week of January, can I still do that on receipt notice or this will surely get denied? Please advise, words looks scary.",

    "content": "I am an OPT student received local government job offer, any realistic path to sponsorship? I'm looking for some advice and perspective on a situation I'm currently in. I'm an F-1 student on OPT. My OPT started on Sept 1, 2025 and ends in Aug 2026. I recently received an offer from a local county government office in South Carolina for a contractprocurement-related role. I visited the office in person, met the team, and as far as I know, I would be the only international employee there. The tricky part is visa sponsorship. They did not ask about visa status or sponsorship during the interview process, but they did complete a background check credit  criminal before issuing the offer. From my understanding, this county typically does not sponsor H-1B, and I know government sponsorship can be rare. That said, my OPT clock is ticking and I don't really have the luxury of waiting much longer. I'm trying to understand:  Is there any realistic way to approach a local government employer about:  STEM OPT, or  H-1B  Has anyone successfully navigated sponsorship with a county or municipal employer?  Is it common for government employers to overlook visa discussions early and then address it later, or is that usually a red flag?  Would it make sense to accept the offer on OPT and revisit sponsorship later, or is that too risky? I'm genuinely interested in the role and the team seemed supportive, but I also want to be realistic and not put myself in a dead end situation immigration wise. Any insights, experiences, or hard truths are appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

In the Visa Bulletin, the EB3 Skilled filing date is June 1, 2023, and it has not moved in several months. If I apply for EB2 NIW and get approval, would that allow me to file the I-485 sooner under the EB2 category using the same priority date? Or should I stick with EB3 and wait for my priority date to become current to file the I-485 under my existing EB3 I-140? Please advise.... Thanks :pray:",

    "content": "I'm a student and I was recently in a car accident in Florida and could really use some guidance. I was driving through an intersection on a green light when another driver ran a red light, hit my car on the left passenger side, and then ran, leaving their car behind. Police came to the scene, a crash report was filed, and I was not at fault. Thankfully, there was a witness who spoke with the police and explained what he saw. My car is a 2024 Toyota Camry, the airbags deployed, and the vehicle was towed,I have GEICO insurance. At the scene I said I felt okay, but I haven't had a medical evaluation yet. As a student without a stable income, this situation is really tough financially. I'm trying to understand what steps I should take next with insurance, whether I should still get checked medically, how rental cars usually work, what to watch out for during the claims process, and how to handle things without straining financially. Any advice or similar experiences would really help --- thank you.",

Waiting time for less than 2 minutes, Greeted Good Afternoon to Immigration Officer and he asked for my I20 and asked to, Keep my 4 fingers on the Scanner 2.

After 75 Mins of Waiting time, 3rd and 4th Officer called back and asked to share all the truth on my journey in USA 6. I was very confident on my Homework and mentioned that I was clean , Despite Officer asked a couple of times As friends suggested not to claim anything if not asked 7.

Catch 3-- After CPT, I applied for OPT via another Desi Consultancy, When the Market is tough and hardly got any calls. But due to my experience and Background, I received Interviews Scheduled for Walmart 1 Months-3 rounds and Amazon 2 months -- 3 Rounds  1 Loop Round , Both rejected after the Final Rounds.

I was Booked with an immediate next Qatar flight , My Mobile Phones and Passports were handed over to the next Qatar Airways Administration and I was handed only with the rest of the luggage. 11. I was treated as a Murderer Criminal from December 24 to December 26 Without my Documents and phone, till the time I was landed into the home country. end of my Story... Notes -- 1. Negative comments are welcome, As I cannot change my Circumstances and situations back in 2023 and also I Don't know which desi Consultancies are black listed in the CBP Portal , I tried every single moment to perform the best in the limited interviews from my OPT Status but I think GOD just had a different Plan. 2. If you can read through my story, People in similar situation can avoid the mistakes or can prepare something to avoid the mistakes which I did. I have couple of questions , If anyone can genuinely help -- Any one Prior Experienced, any Attorney Or People who moved out of USA with similar Situation  1. Is there any way I can request to remove the 5 year BAN ? Any Attorney who i can speak to ? 2. With 5-year BAN , Can I ask travel for any other country for a Work opportunity ? Example -- Canada, Australia, Germany , I understand the 5 eyes Rule, But What are the chances. 3. If I can explore Job opportunities in any other country , What countries would not consider the USA Data or What countries will allow to work. ? a. I am currently applying opportunities at my home Country , but If I can look out for Abroad opportunities then which one I can apply for ? 4. Will I have issues with Traveling any other country, on a tourist Visa ? Need some guidance after all the nightmare I went through , Hoping for some Support Thank you,",

Timeline:  I was on H-1B and lost my job on August 27, 2025  Within the 60-day grace period, I filed and moved to H-4  H-4 extension was filed on September 25, 2025 still pending  I received a new job offer in December 2025  Employer filed H-1B Change of Status H-4  H-1 in premium processing on December 10, 2025  My I-94 expires on January 5, 2026  USCIS issued an RFE stating they cannot adjudicate the H-1 COS while the H-4 application is still pending My concern is that H-4 approvals are currently taking 6 months, and I may lose my job if I have to wait for H-4 approval first. I'm also worried that depending on how the RFE is answered, USCIS may push the case to consular processing, which would require travel to India, where visa appointment dates are very limited and the process is a major hardship. Questions URGENT:  Has anyone faced this exact situation where H-1 COS was blocked due to pending H-4?  After responding to the RFE, did USCIS adjudicate the H-4 first and then approve H-1 COS without forcing consular processing?  Did anyone successfully avoid consular processing in a similar scenario? Any real experiences or guidance would be greatly appreciated :pray:",
